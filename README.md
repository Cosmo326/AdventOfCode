# AdventOfCode

[AdventOfCode](https://adventofcode.com/)

I created a day runner that will allow you to rerun any days or all days.  
If the advent calendar is still on going you can run the current day by simply running the latest executable will display my results for today.  
To run any individual day use the -Day flag followed by the day number to run.  
To see my results for all days use the -All flag
